# Lection 01 - Introduction
Build large software system is complex, the complexity is faced by two approaches:
*__Abstraction__
*__Models__

## Abstraction
>  process of formulating generalized ideas or concepts by extracting common qualities from specific examples. 

## Models
> A representation of the system under analysis that answers as the system does for a given set of questions
> All models are in simulacra, that is, simplified reflections of reality, but, despite their inherent falsity, they are nevertheless extremely useful
