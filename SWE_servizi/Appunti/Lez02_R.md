# Evolutin of SOA
SOA was dismised in 2009 but survived by its offspring (SaaS, Cloud Computing) and all product based on _services_.

## SOA Manifesto
Service orientation is the paradigm through which the architecture is defined.
It's best viewed as a method or an approach for
realizing a specific target state that is further defined by a set of strategic goals and benefits.

Agility at a business level is comparable to an organization's responsiveness. The
more easily and effectively an organization can respond to business change, the
more efficient and successful it will be to adapting to the impacts of the change. 

Services as IT assets that are expected to provide repeated value over time that exceeds the initial investment. 
Service orientation aims to resuse services so this aspect invole less expense because there's minimum need to build new solution. 

 The need to accommodate business
change on an on-going basis is foundational to service orientation so it isn't a separate aspect of the business but it's entangled with it. 

### Values
Soa aims to prioritize over some aspects we value:
What to prioritize | What we value
-------------------|--------------
Business value | Technical strategy
Strategic goals | Project-specific benefits
Intrinsic interoperability| Custom integration
Shared services | Specific-purpose implementations
Flexibility | Optimization
Evolutionary refinement | Pursuit of inizial perfection


#### Business value over techincal strategy
The adoption of service orientation is that they are business-driven which means that business vision
dictating the utilization of technology. All other
values and principles in the manifesto, in one way or another, support the realization
of this value.

#### Strategic goals over project-specific benefits
Many IT projects focused solely on building applications designed specifically to automate business process requirements that were current at that
time. It resulted in IT enterprise filled with islands of logic and data referred to as application **silos**. As new business requirements would emerge, either new silos were created or integration channels between silos was established. 

The latter approach involes burdensome, expensive, and slow
to evolve solutions.

Service orientation emerged in response of this problems. 

#### Intrinsic interoperability over custom integration
 To enable interoperability between incompatible software programs requires that they
be integrated. **Integration is therefore the effort required to achieve interoperability**. Integration can be expensive and time consuming and can lead to fragile architectures.

Service orientation is to minimize the need for customized integration by shaping programs that are natively compatible.

#### Shared services over specific-purpose implementations
The encapsulation of multi-purpose logic that can be
shared and reused in support of the automation of different business processes. A shared service as a IT asset can provide repeated business value (reuse).


#### Flexibility over optimization
Optimization primarily refers to the fulfillment of tactical gains by tuning a given
application design or expediting (*accelerare*) its delivery to meet immediate needs. It can lead to silos based envirorment when not prioritized in relation to *flexibility*.

Services must also be flexible in how they can be combined
and aggregated into composite solutions.
 When an existing business process
changes or when a new business process is introduced, we need to be able to add,
remove, and extend services within the composition architecture with minimal
(integration) effort. 

#### Evolutionary refinement over pursuit of initial perfection
Service orientation advocates the
attainment of agility on an organizational or business level with the intention of
empowering the organization, as a whole, to be responsive to change. This aspect is called **strategic agility** and the focus is the **longevity** the business works toward a targe state that includes agility with long-term strategic value.
